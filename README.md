# angular-js-contact-keeper
sample project for convert angular JS to angular 8


## Running

We have a simple server side which we run using 

`npm run server` - this runs a json-server and refreshes the data bases on each run so the deleted contacts will appear again.

To run the application we type

`npm start` - this loads the application using a local webserver, check the console for the port number to use.
